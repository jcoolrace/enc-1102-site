      My understanding of research has entirely changed as a result of this research write-up. Since then, I now understand that ‘research’ consists of understanding the current scholarly conversation by examining other scholarly papers. This is fundamentally different than research I have conducted in the past, as it was primarily based on secondary sources and aggregations of other’s research, rather than looking directly at the research that others have published. I believe some of the literacy tasks I was asked to complete were based on growing the understanding of how the research, revision, and writing process works in an academic environment. Something that I personally struggled with was finding the right way to organize the information that I wanted to present to my audience. There were certain pieces of information and ideas that I had difficulty finding the best time to present. They were all important points to my overall discussion, but organizing those points were at times difficult. However, I now have a better understanding of how to conduct research and how to begin to get involved in scholarly research. This research has a certain format and set of norms that need to be abided by, and understanding how to engage in that can be important for furthering the general public knowledge.
